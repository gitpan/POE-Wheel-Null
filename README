NAME
    POE::Wheel::Null - POE Wheel that does put()s data nowhere, and sends
    nothing.

SYNOPSIS
    As a primary use whenever you would normally...

     delete $heap->{wheel};

    or something equivalent, instead do...

     $heap->{wheel} = POE::Wheel::Null->new();

    to prevent calls to $heap->{wheel} from causing runtime errors in perl.
    This seems to be a Good Idea (tm) when working with long running
    programs in the traditional POE way.

DESCRIPTION
    POE::Wheel::Null creates a wheel which doesn't do anything upon put(),
    and doesn't send any events to the current session.

PUBLIC METHODS
    new
      The new() method creates a new null wheel.

    ID

    put
